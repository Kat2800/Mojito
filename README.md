# The Mojito Project by BlacKat

## Why is called "Mojito" like the cocktail? üç∏
This project is called "Mojito" beacuse while the developers were coding this project, they were drinking non-alcoholic Mojitos (maked by @rickyfili10)
![Mojito](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b10b95f5-7286-47bb-a8e1-64bc07b0ffd4)

# What's that? ü§î
Mojito is swiss army knife for ethical hacking (educational purposes only) and runs on a raspberry pi 0 w/wh that use a wavseshare 1.44 inch lcd HAT display. It have a collection of hacking tools and it is based on Kali Linux.

## USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK. 

# REQUIREMENTS üìÉ
  - Wavseshare 1.44 inch lcd HAT display 
  - Raspberry pi 0 w/wh 
  - 16 GB sd card (You need much less, but you might need 16 GB for additional packages)
  - An external usb antenna that support packet injection and monitor mode. We recommend RTL8812BU or RTL8822BU Chipsets
  - An USB to Micro USB adapter
# HOW TO SETUP AND INSTALL MOJITO? 
1. Flash and setup kali linux for raspberry pi 0 wh  <br>{<br>
    You can get kali linux official image from: [Download Kali Linux](https://kali.download/arm-images/kali-2024.4/kali-linux-2024.4-raspberry-pi-zero-w-armel.img.xz)  <br>
    You can flash the image on the sd using Balena Etcher. You can get it from: [Download Balena Etcher](https://etcher.balena.io) <br>
}<br>
3. Put a wpa_supplicant.conf with your wifi information inside the sd card and create a file called "ssh" with nothing inside. <br>{<br>
    Don't know how to write a wpa_supplican file? No problem! [Wpa supplicant file example](https://github.com/asparatu/raspberrypi-wpa-supplicant.conf/blob/master/wpa_supplicant.conf)<br>
}<br>
### ‚ö†Ô∏è REMEMBER: THE PASSWORD WILL BE ALWAYS "kali" ‚ö†Ô∏è
4. Connect to USB port, and if you have it connect the antenna on the second port, Then wait... (The first boot is slow, don't worry it's normal!). Then, connect to it using ssh, for example:
```
ssh kali@192.168.1.xxx
```
You can see Mojito ip form your WiFi.
If it doesn't seem to appear, try connecting it to an HDMI and plugging a keyboard into it to try to connect.<br>
You can use this to connect manually from an hdmi and keyboard setup
```
sudo iwconfig wlan0 up
sudo nmcli device wifi connect "{your wifi SSID}" password "{your wifi password}"
sudo enable ssh
sudo start ssh
```
5. Install and setup requisites with the commands below
## ‚ö†Ô∏è IF YOU HAVE ALREADY AN EXTERNAL ANTENNA THAT SUPPORT PACKET INJECTION WITH A RECOMMEND CHIPSETS BY US INSTALL THIS ‚ö†Ô∏è
### Else skip to Clone the Mojito repostory and enter in it 
## Method 1 (Credit to morrownr on github)
 ```
git clone https://github.com/morrownr/88x2bu-20210702.git && cd 88x2bu-20210702
 ```
 ```
sudo bash install-driver.sh
sudo reboot
 ```
### ‚ö†Ô∏è BE CAREFUL NOT TO BLACKLIST INSTALLED DRIVERS ‚ö†Ô∏è
## Method 2
 ```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install realtek-rtl88xxau-dkms -y
sudo apt upgrade
sudo reboot
```
## Clone the Mojito repostory and enter in it 
### Remember: Kali does not support pip. To install packages you can use "sudo apt install python3-name"
 ```
  git clone https://github.com/rickyfili10/Mojito.git && cd Mojito/src
 ```
## Install the requisites üìÉ
 ```
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt-get install libbluetooth-dev
    sudo apt install python3-spidev python3-RPi.gpio
    sudo pip install git+https://github.com/pybluez/pybluez 
```
   ### <br>Set the time zone 
```
    sudo timedatectl set-timezone {your local time zone} -- EXAMPLE FOR ITALY: "sudo timedatectl set-timezone Europe/Rome"
```
  ### Install l2flood ‚õìÔ∏è‚Äçüí•
```
  git clone https://github.com/kovmir/l2flood
  cd l2flood
  make # Use `make serial` to build upstream l2ping.
  sudo make install
```
   ### Enabling SPi
```
sudo sed -i "s/#dtparam=spi=on/dtparam=spi=on/" "/boot/config.txt"
```   
  ### Execute Mojito at boot and set his hostname
```
  sudo cp mojito.service /etc/systemd/system/
```
```
 sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```
```
  sudo systemctl enable mojito.service
```
```
  sudo systemctl start mojito.service
```
```
  sudo hostnamectl set-hostname Mojito
```
```
  sudo reboot
```

## After a while it should display the Mojito menu! üéâ
